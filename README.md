# GIC3002
 
An remake of my old project GIC3001

Everthing started ass a highschool project. Me and my friend was trying to make a small LED-display,
that could be controlled from a computer. We called it GIC2000. We failed to get it to work, but we
where close. A few years later I resumed the project and got it to work. The project was named GIC3000.
Unfortunatly I lost the sourcecode in a harddrive crash. But I later remade a working version of it.

That version was GIC3002. It uses a ATMEGA8535 microcontroller. The program is simpler than the one for
GIC3000 and is written in assembler. But assembler is difficult to change the program, so i decided to
rewrite the program in C.

Here it is. Named GIC 3002
